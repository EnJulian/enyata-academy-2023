1.  - The let and const keywords are used when declaring variables in javascript.
    - Let and const are block scoped while var is function scoped. This means var variables can be declared and accessed through out a code globally, 
        inside functions or outside functions while let and const can only be accessed inside functions scopes.
    - Let and const variables cannot be redeclared while var variable can.

2. We can use a variable after declaration by simply calling it in our code or by using the console.log function to print value assigned to the variable if any.

3. We can declare a string using quotation marks before the name of the string after our assignment operator when declaring any variable.

4. It is acceptable to use either double or single quotes when declaring a string however using a quotation mark inside a string name when declaring with single quotes can result in errors.

5. "9" makes the data type of declaration a string and 9 without quotes makes the data type an integer.

6.  - Declaration means to create a variable name which will get initialized in memory.
    - Redeclaration means to recreate an existing variable in a code block or function
    - Assignment means to give a declared variable a value in our code.
    - Reassignment means to change the value in an already declared and assigned variable. However variables declared with the const keyword cannot have its value reassigned.
